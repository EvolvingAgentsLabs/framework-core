# Framework Core üß™ ALPHA

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Experimental Research Project** - This is an early-stage research prototype exploring architectural patterns derived from LLMunix experiments. This project will remain permanently in alpha status.

Experimental architectural patterns and building blocks derived from LLMunix's adaptive behavior management research. This is an ongoing exploration of reusable agent system components.

---

## Overview

Framework Core is an experimental project that attempts to distill architectural insights from LLMunix research into reusable patterns. This is early-stage exploration and should be treated as research material rather than production-ready components.

**Research Focus**: Exploring how LLMunix's **Adaptive Behavior Management** concepts might translate into generalizable architectural patterns for experimental agent systems.

## Key Innovations from LLMunix

### üß† Experimental Sentient State Patterns
Research into how **behavioral constraints** might modify agent decision-making:
- **Dynamic Constraint Evolution**: Experimental approaches to behavior adaptation based on context
- **Memory-Driven Learning**: Research prototypes exploring historical pattern integration
- **Modular State Components**: Early explorations of atomic state file architectures

### üéØ Adaptive Behavior Research
Experimental investigations into dynamic behavior modification:
- **User Sentiment Research**: Prototype systems for emotional state detection
- **Priority Adaptation Experiments**: Research into execution focus shifting mechanisms
- **Persona Switching Prototypes**: Early-stage communication style adaptation research
- **Error Tolerance Studies**: Experimental risk acceptance adjustment systems

### üîç Memory System Experiments
Research prototypes investigating structured experience databases:
- **YAML Frontmatter Research**: Experimental querying approaches for execution history
- **Behavioral Pattern Studies**: Research into user preference evolution tracking
- **Adaptive Recommendation Prototypes**: Early-stage context-aware guidance systems

**For the complete implementation of these concepts, see the [LLMunix project](https://github.com/EvolvingAgentsLabs/llmunix).**

## Architecture Patterns

### 1. Adaptive State Management Pattern

Based on LLMunix's sentient state architecture:

```
agent-workspace/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ state/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plan.md          # Execution roadmap and metadata
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ context.md       # Accumulated knowledge base
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ variables.json   # Structured data passing
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ history.md       # Complete execution log
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ constraints.md   # Behavioral modifiers (the sentient layer)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ outputs/            # Task results and artifacts
```

### 2. Behavioral Constraint Pattern

Dynamic behavior modification through evolving constraints:

```yaml
# constraints.md example
user_sentiment: "frustrated"          # Detected emotional state
priority: "speed_and_clarity"         # Execution focus
active_persona: "concise_assistant"   # Communication style
error_tolerance: "strict"             # Risk acceptance level
human_review_trigger_level: "low"     # Escalation threshold
```

### 3. Memory-Driven Decision Pattern

Intelligent consultation of historical experiences:

```yaml
# memory-entry.yml

## How to Use This Framework

This repository provides the minimal "kernel" files. To build your own LLM-OS instance:

1.  **Clone this repository.**
2.  **Create your "software":** Add `components/agents/` and `components/tools/` directories and populate them with your own markdown-defined agents and tools.
3.  **Define your tasks:** Create a `scenarios/` directory with markdown files that describe high-level goals.
4.  **Boot your OS:** Use the `LLMUNIX` master prompt (found in the [LLMUNIX repository](https://github.com/EvolvingAgentsLabs/llmunix)) to instruct your chosen LLM to run your system.

## Future Vision & Roadmap

This framework is the foundation for a new kind of computing. Our vision is to build upon this core to create even more powerful and sophisticated autonomous systems. Our upcoming development will focus on these key areas:

üå± **Autonomous Evolution & Self-Improvement**
-   The system will not only create new components but also analyze its own performance from `SmartMemory.md` to proactively evolve its existing agents and tools for better efficiency, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness.

üõ°Ô∏è **Controlled Evolution (Firmware)**
-   We will introduce a `Firmware.md` component that defines a set of immutable rules, ethical constraints, and operational boundaries. This will guide the agent's evolution, ensuring that even as it improves itself, it adheres to core principles and safety protocols.

‚ö° **Parallel Task Processing**
-   To overcome the single-threaded nature of current LLMs, we will develop a "Process Manager" agent and state management techniques that allow the SystemAgent to orchestrate and manage multiple, concurrent task executions, similar to multitasking in a modern OS.

üîå **Multi-LLM Engine Support**
-   The framework will be enhanced to be truly LLM-agnostic. A new layer will allow the `SystemAgent` to dynamically choose the best LLM for a specific task (e.g., a creative model for content generation, a logic-focused model for planning) and manage interactions across different AI engines.

üåê **Distributed Environments**
-   We aim to extend the OS concept to distributed systems. This will enable multiple LLMUNIX instances to communicate, share components from their libraries, and collaborate on goals that a single agent could not accomplish alone.

üñ•Ô∏è **Intuitive User Interface (UI/UX)**
-   ...?

We believe these next steps will push the boundaries of what's possible with document-centric AI and create a truly adaptive and intelligent operating system.
